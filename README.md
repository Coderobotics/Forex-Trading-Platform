Forex Trading PHP Script

This Forex Trading PHP script allows users to trade on real Forex stocks and crypto pairs. The trading data is supplied through an API from alphavantage.co, which provides real-time chart data and price data for trading as well. So the chart and asset prices are real for each pair. The users will see a normal “candlestick chart” for any pair they want to trade on. They will view their trade live for each active order (buy or sell). Their profit or loss, as well as equity, is calculated in real-time. This platform is built with PHP and JavaScript (no frameworks). Forex Trading PHP project uses MySQL for a database. Note that you can get a premium API key from https://alphavantage.co to unlock all pairs. Currently, the demo only allows trading on EUR/USD and ETH/USD. Forex Trading PHP platform feels real and legit as the trader only has to sit and watch his trades in real-time. View all trades of all users on the platform along with their live profit and loss (unrealized). Know which users are currently online (viewing a trade). Spike the chart (manipulate the chart) at any point in time. The chart will move slightly up/down depending on the admin’s direction. This spiking will do two things; Move the chart to the new value and affect the user’s current trade (affecting his unrealized profit/loss). The chart will then return to render the original data for that pair (but the previous spiked data remains in chart history as the candlesticks move back)
